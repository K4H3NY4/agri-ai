## Problem

Farmers lack sufficient information about which crops to cultivate. Consequently, they continue to grow the same unprofitable crops each year due to their reluctance to experiment with new ones.

## Solution
Designing an AI bot tailored to the local context to provide crop recommendations based on inputs such as altitude, crop type, and maturity days, while also considering current market prices for optimal decision-making.

## Solution

Developing a user-friendly web application utilizing OpenAI's Language Model (LLM) to provide straightforward and accessible crop recommendations based on inputs such as altitude, crop type, maturity days, and current market prices.
